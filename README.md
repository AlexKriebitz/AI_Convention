The Institute for Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (IEAI) is pleased to announce the publication of a draft convention on AI, Data, and Human Rights on GitHub. This milestone follows the International AI and Human Rights Summit held in Munich on July 16, 2024, co-organized with Globethics.

<strong>Munich Convention on AI, Data and Human Rights</strong>

The draft, now referred to as the "Munich Convention on AI, Data and Human Rights," synthesizes insights from over 50 global experts who participated in the summit. By publishing on ArXiv, we acknowledge that this initiative has evolved beyond its origins and now belongs to the global community.

<strong>Key Features</strong>

The convention aims to:
<ul>
 <li>Inspire international dialogue on integrating human rights into a global AI framework.</li>

 <li>Address critical areas including:</li>
  <ul>  
 <li>Definitions of AI systems, AI lifecycle, and data</li>

 <li>Prohibited use cases of AI</li>

 <li>Domains crucial for human rights enjoyment</li>
</ul>
 <li>Continue the existing tradition of embedding human rights as foundational principles of in international law, set by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Charter</li>

 </ul>

While <strong>not</strong> establishing a binding framework and not aiming to do so, the convention seeks to <strong>catalyze debate on concrete aspects that the international community must address</strong>.

<strong>Next Steps</strong>

We are now seeking feedback from organizations and individuals to refine and elevate the convention.
